# AES-implementation
Simple execution of Encryption and Decryption of AES
\
\
\
This tool is a simple Python-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).\

The project includes an interactive GUI to make it easy for users to input text, choose an encryption algorithm, and view both encrypted and decrypted results.\

Technologies Used:\
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Tkinter: A Python library used for building the graphical user interface.
PyCryptodome: A Python library providing cryptographic functions, including AES and DES.
