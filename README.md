# AES-implementation
Simple execution of Encryption and Decryption of AES
\
\
\
This tool is a simple Python-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
\

The project includes an interactive GUI to make it easy for users to input text, choose an encryption algorithm, and view both encrypted and decrypted results.
\
______________________________
Technologies Used:
\
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
\
Tkinter: A Python library used for building the graphical user interface.
\
PyCryptodome: A Python library providing cryptographic functions, including AES and DES.

# How to Use:
\
1. Run the application:
\
python src/gui.py
\
Open the python program and run it to open UI window.
\
\
2. Encryption:
\
Type the text you want to encrypt in the text box.
\
Select either AES or DES.
\
Click Encrypt. The application will display the encrypted text and a generated key, which is needed for decryption.
\
\
3. Decryption:
\
Enter the encrypted text and the key into the respective fields.
\
Click Decrypt to view the original text.
